# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application or extend this Snake game, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

## Choosen Project
This repo is based on https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Capstone-Snake-Game
For completing this Project a Highscore list is added.
The highscore list is saved under build/highscore.txt
When starting the game, the user has different options:
1. View best users and their score
2. Select from players in highscore list
3. Create a new player
After finishing the game the user will be added to the Highscore list, if the score is higher than 0. If the user is already in the Highscore list, the highscore will be updated.

## Rubric Criteria
1. Loops, Functions: Use of different control structeres: if-else, while, switch, continue, break, range-based loop, for loop, while-loop. 
2. I/O: Highscore is read and written to text file.
3. User In/Output: User, can select different options, input his name, output highscore list, etc.
4. OOP: Added new classes and functions
5. Function Overloading: Player constructor
6. Classes use appropriate access specifiers for class members
7. Class constructors utilize member initialization lists and default values.
8. Usage of references: for example in gamemenuinterface.cpp Line 139
